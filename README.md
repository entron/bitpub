bitpub
======

A distributed information publishing platform. It could be used as the infrasture for academic publication, blogs or social network etc. There are a few reasons to make such a platform decentralized. 

First of all, public information and the right to publish information should belong to the public. The content published by the user should not be controlled by one company. When the author made the content public then every one should be able to access them without paying a third party to get the permission. As a byproduct it will also encourage innovation.

Second, it is more difficult to lose important information or access to information due to server breaking down as the information is likely to have multiple copies arround the world served simutaneously.
